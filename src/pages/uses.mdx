## Code editor

- **Code editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my code editor.
- **Color theme**: [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) by Sarah Drasner.
- **Font**: [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono?a=810537075) by Phil Pluckthun.

## Video stuff

- **Camera**: [Sony alpha 6100](https://amzn.to/423jjgO). It has great colors and amazing autofocus.
  - **Lens**: [Sigma 16mm F/1.4](https://amzn.to/41G4yR6). Blurry background and cinematic look. This might be my favourite piece of equipment â€”Â I LOVE it.
- **Keylight**: My main key light is an [Amaran 200X S](https://amzn.to/4iDYekk).
  - **Softbox**: The Amaran light is paired with an [Apurture Lightdome SE softbox](https://amzn.to/4kX9vh9).
  - **Wall mount**: The light + softbox are mounted directly on the wall with a [Neewer wall mounting triangle boom](https://amzn.to/4j3Mtnb).
- **Elgato lights**: I use two [Elgato Keylights](https://amzn.to/4j2g7Je) for my fill and back lights. The lights are great, but the software controlling them is often frustrating. I also own two [Keylight Airs](https://amzn.to/421zF9F) that I now use to light my background.

## Audio stuff

- **On-camera microphone**: [Earthworks Icon Pro](https://amzn.to/4bCrwNB). I absolutely love it. It has the broacast/dynamic qualities of an [SM7B](https://amzn.to/3FCVaWZ) (which I also own), with the clarity of a high-end condenser microphone.
- **Off-camera microphone**: [Senheiser MKE-600](https://amzn.to/4433KZ4) is what I rock when you don't see the mic in the frame. It's very hard to beat the price/quality ratio of this microphone, but you need [good room acoustics](https://www.betterdevscreencasts.com/posts/preparing-room-for-audio-recordings) to benefit from it.
- **Audio interface**: I use the **Rodecaster Pro (original)**, but would recommend the [Rodecaster Pro Duo](https://amzn.to/4ihjTP8) instead in 2025. I really want one myself ðŸ˜…
- **Boom arms (x2)**: [Elgato Wave Low Profile](https://amzn.to/4l304N0) and [Rode PSA1+](https://amzn.to/3Y26ylr). One comes from below (Elgato), and one from above (Rode) ðŸ¤£

## I got wayyyyy more stuff

This list could get much bigger. While I won't list _everything_ I own, I will try complete and update this page in the future ðŸ¤—
