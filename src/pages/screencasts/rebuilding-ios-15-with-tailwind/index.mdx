<IntroText>

Rebuilding the iOS 15 notification summary UI with Tailwind CSS is one of my all time favourite screencasts that I have produced. And one of the most popular too!

It was a lot of fun putting this one together.

This video caught a lot of attention and really hit a nerve with the Tailwind CSS community.

It makes sense, there is a lot of creative design to it, and it really showcases the "design in the browser" capability of Tailwind CSS.

Here's the screencast, enjoy!
