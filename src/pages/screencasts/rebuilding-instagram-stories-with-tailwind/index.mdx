This video was never planned, or rehearsed. I woke up one morning and decided to hit record and "Just Do Itâ„¢".

It was at a time where the Instatram Stories UI (those delightful gradient rings) were popping everywhere. I thought it would be a fun exercise to build these Tailwind CSS!

Once again, one of the most popular videos on the Tailwind Labs YouTube channel. I see a trend here.

The videos where I have the most fun, where the topic is less serious... tend to do really well with the community.

Here's the screencast, enjoy!
