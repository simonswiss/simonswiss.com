  Last Monday, I took a leap of faith and made my first public speaking appearance at a Sydney tech
  meetup. The event in questions was [React Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/React-Sydney), a monthly
  event where tickets go like hot cakes and waiting lists get notoriously long.

The topic I came to talk about was React-Music, an awesome open-source project that lets you create beats with ReactJS. React-Music is a creation by [Ken Wheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler), director of open-source at [FormidableLabs](https://formidable.com).

The talk went really well, considering it was heavily relying on live demos, which could have
gone horribly wrongâ€¦ :)

Here are links to the [slides of the talk](https://slides.com/simonswiss/react-music), as well as to the [github repo with the live demos](https://github.com/simonswiss/react-music) presented during the talk.
