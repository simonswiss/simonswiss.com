  You’ve probably heard that a very alpha version of Tailwind CSS v4 [has been open sourced](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha).

It’s not ready for production yet, but let's tale a look at how it simplifies setting up a multi-theme strategy.

</IntroText>

## Theme configuration in CSS

One of the key new features in v4 is the ability to customize the theme directly in a CSS file instead of the Tailwind config.

Theme values (like colors, font sizes, spacing) can be defined with CSS variables like so:

```css
/* app/styles.css */
@import 'tailwindcss' @theme {
  --color-primary: #aab9ff;
}
```

This is the equivalent of doing the following in Tailwind CSS v3:

```tsx
// tailwind.config.ts
export default {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#aab9ff',
    },
  },
}
```

In v4, the CSS variables are also exposed in your CSS output, which means you can “consume” those variables anywhere you need it:

```html
<div class="bg-[--color-primary]"></div>
```

## Multi-Theme Strategy in Tailwind

If you’ve taken my [Multi-Theme Strategy workshop](https://www.protailwind.com/workshops/multi-theme-strategy), you know that the procedure to define _themable_ CSS variables was somewhat convoluted:

### 1. Define CSS variables holding `R` `G` `B` channels

```css
:root {
  --primary: 170 185 255;
}
```

### 2. Compose that CSS variable with an `rgb()` function + `<alpha-value>` to add a color in the `tailwind.config.ts` file

```tsx
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: rbg(var(--primary) / <alpha-value>)
    }
  }
}
```

Honestly, this is quite painful. And forces you to define your colors in a weird, custom format (space-separated `R` `G` and `B` channels).

## It’s way easier in Tailwind v4

Tailwind CSS v4 drastically simplifies the process of defining themable CSS variables:

### 1. Define a CSS variable with _any_ color format, in CSS

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #aab9ff;
}
```

### 2. That’s it! there is no step 2.

You can redefine this variable value at different theme scopes like so:

```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #aab9ff;
}

@layer base {
  [data-theme='ocean'] {
    --color-primary: #aab9ff;
  }

  [data-theme='rainforest'] {
    --color-primary: #56d0a0;
  }

  [data-theme='candy'] {
    --color-primary: #f9a8d4;
  }
}
```

And that’s all you need to apply themable classes to your HTML:

<CaptionImage src={theming1} alt="Minimal theming strategy in Tailwind v4">
  Minimal theming strategy in Tailwind v4
</CaptionImage>

You’ll notice we’re consuming the CSS variable with an arbitrary value here. This is because using the `bg-primary` class directly would retrieve the actual HEX color defined in the `@theme` block:

<CaptionImage src={theming2} alt="CSS class hover showing the HEX value consumption">
  Utilities generated from the `@theme` block will consume the actual color value defined.
</CaptionImage>

If you want to use “normal” utility classes like `bg-primary` directly, you can go an extra step:

## Mapping the `@theme` CSS variables to another variable

You can define _another_ CSS variable which will be consumed by the `@theme` theme variable:

<CaptionImage src={theming3} alt="Advanced theming setup">
  Theming setup to support `bg-primary` directly
</CaptionImage>

This time, the `bg-primary` class will consume a CSS variable that changes for every theme scope.

## No `<alpha-value>` needed!

Did you notice we didn’t have to _construct_ an `rgb()` color composed with the `<alpha-value>`?

Opacity support straight up works with HEX or any other color format, because Tailwind CSS v4 is using [`color-mix()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix) to compose the opacity:

<CaptionImage src={theming4} alt="Opacity support without alpha-value">
  Opacity support without using Tailwind's internal `<alpha-value>`.
</CaptionImage>

## Updating the Multi-Theme Strategy workshop

This all means that some parts of the [Multi-Theme Strategy workshop](https://www.protailwind.com/workshops/multi-theme-strategy) _could_ be simplified.

I say _could_, because right now, there is no Plugin API support for Tailwind CSS v4. There isn’t even support for the `tailwind.config` file.

In other words, you can manually define themable CSS variables, but you can’t automate the process of passing a JSON theme to a plugin and have it generate all the theming parts for you.

When that becomes available, I’ll definitely look into upgrading the strategy to the best possible approach in v4!

Have a great day ❤️
