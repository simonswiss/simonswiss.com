## Starting with a bang 💥

New Year resolutions are fun. Most of the time, they're out the window within a few weeks.

In this case, one thing I **really** wanted to do was to produce an [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) course on [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The sooner the better. I committed early, and within the first two weeks of the year, I was done. My course was in queue for publishing.

A few weeks later, there it was! [Build User Interfaces by Composing CSS Utility Classes with Tailwind](https://egghead.io/courses/build-user-interfaces-by-composing-css-utility-classes-with-tailwind).

As I am writing this post, the course has been completed by **more than 400 people** and has **a rating of 4.6/5** based on 83 ratings!

## Building a team 💪

In March, I organised my first series of interviews, as we were hiring for a front-end developer position at [SocietyOne](https://societyone.com.au/).

I was responsible for creating the job ad, promoting it, reviewing applicants, scheduling phone interviews, in-person interviews etc.

I surprisingly *really* enjoyed the whole process. I think I was pretty good at it too! A few applicants mentioned they found the whole procedure very friendly and well conducted. 🤗

In April, we hired a fantastic candidate, my now good friend [Verity Stothard](https://twitter.com/VerityStothard), who turned out to be a great fit!

## Berlin Bound! ✈️🍻

This is a big one for me. One of these *way out of the comfort zone* thing.

On May 15th 2018, my good buddy [Andrew Welch](https://twitter.com/nystudio107) suggested I submitted a talk for the DotAll 2018 conference organised by the CraftCMS folks.

The *Call For Speakers* was closing in less than 24 hours. I giggled, and went back to work.

<blockquote>“Seriously, Simon. Submit a talk”, Andrew said.</blockquote>

_Sure, why not_. So I put together a talk outline for a topic I have at heart: utility-first CSS.

The next morning, I woke up to an e-mail titled _“Speaking at Dot All 2018”_.

😱😱😱

Just like that, I found myself embarking on an epic 40+ hour journey across the globe to Berlin!

The CraftCMS community is special. It's truly something else. I couldn't wait to catch up with all these people I consider friends but have never met in real life.

Slack buddies, twitter buddies, but no IRL buddies.

Oh and my close friend, mentor, colleague, and the reason I submitted the talk in the first place: Andrew Welch.

  So, ummm.. I stepped on stage at an international conference and I nailed it! 😎

I had a blast! The conference was superb. Such a welcoming and interesting community. Everyone knows each other from Slack, but mingling in person was awesome.

Uumm.. so [my talk](/talks/dot-all-2018) was scheduled to close day 1 of the conference. Sort of a mini keynote! :) It went extremely well and the discussions it sparked showed my presentation definitely hit a nerve.

These few days in Berlin are a sure highlight of my year!

## Laracon AU 🇦🇺

Same talk, different community. *Home crowd* here in Sydney.

My second ever conference talk, and also my second in three weeks!

Stepping on stage didn't feel nearly as overwhelming as it did in Berlin. I had done it before, and although still very nervous, I knew I could do it again.

This time, my talk was scheduled early in the morning. The second talk of the conference, right after the headline opening act: [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan).

Holy crap.

Adam is *kind of a big deal* in the Laravel community. He is also the author of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework I feature multiple times in my talk.

It was both an honour and a fright to go right after Adam.

The talk went well. I had some dreadful "clicker" hiccups that messed up the flow of my talk (timing, jokes..) but I am happy with how I delivered the talk overall. The [feedback from the audience](https://thermostat.io/p/1222e409/ce7aec33e98dbce4) was really positive too!

Overall, another incredible conference. The talks were very interesting, but again my highlight was the people I met.

Oh - hanging out with 3/4 of the Tailwind CSS crew was real fun! It's awesome to spend some quality time with people that build software you use every day. I am a people person, and getting to know the fine folks behind Tailwind makes me appreciate the framework 10x more!

## B'ball Championship 🏀🏆

If I'm not writing code, I love playing basketball and surfing.

When I moved to Sydney 4 years ago, I joined a rec league competition, it's good fun!

The team is awesome. We're almost all dads. At 37, I am one of the youngest players on the team. But we whooped a bunch of athletic teams in their early 20s.

We get in their heads and grind them out. And we're the league champs! 💪

Love this team. As long as I live in Sydney, I'll be playing with them! Years go by and I get slower, but I can still drain threes like there's no tomorrow! 👌

## Landed a new job 🙌

To wrap things up - I have some exciting news: I will be joining [Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au/) in January 2019.

This should be really exciting, very much looking forward to this new chapter!

## Wrapping it up

I am pretty pleased with myself and what I have accomplished in 2018. I am now wrapping up the year with my little family on a camping trip.

See you all in 2019! ❤️
