<IntroText>

I am a self-taught front-end developer. I owe a large portion of what I know to some incredible individuals who took the time to create video tutorials â€” paid or free â€” and make them available to the world.

</IntroText>

Before working in front-end, I was a primary school teacher. I always loved teaching, and still very much enjoy doing code mentoring with colleagues and clients.

I also always enjoyed video editing.

Over the past near decade, Iâ€™ve been cutting clips of **travel / family stuff** on my [personal YouTube account](http://youtube.com/simonswiss), but never anything web-development related.

## Doing something about it

I always had it in the back of my mind. I also always had that fear of not bringing anything new that most of us have when it comes to submitting a talk, a blog post orâ€¦ video tutorials!

English is also not my mother language. I am very fluent, but it still adds a level of insecurity to put yourself out there in a foreign language.

Last New Yearâ€™s Eve, I came up with a simple resolution: start doing a video series on **something** in 2016.

Fast forward a third of the year â€” and here I was, still thinking about doing it, but **not actually doing anything**. There is always too much work, too much to learn in the JavaScript churn.. always an excuse to push back.

## Getting pro-active

On the 1st of May, I did what I should have done much earlier: become pro-active. I ordered a decent microphone â€” the Blue Yeti, more on that later â€” which would sit on my desk and make me feel stupid for not making any use of it.

A few minutes after ordering the mic, I got really excited and started writing down the scripts for the first few videos of my first series called [Jade/Pug Tips in 90 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqCs1pdmf9o&list=PLHrxuCR-0CcSWiMuLf58iuIsNlP549-Sk). The simple fact that I knew I now had invested in this mic instantly made me get the ball rolling.

## A mental shift

Most importantly â€” I had a mental shift about the fear of doing things. Yes, there are other screencasts about Jade out there. Yes, some may be more advanced.

The fact is: **I donâ€™t care**. I am doing my own things, and bringing my own contribution to the wonderful web development community. I feel good about it â€” and take pride in trying to produce some high quality material.

## My first steps

A few days later, my Blue Yeti arrived from the post. It is bigger and heavier than I expected. The resistance and clickity-ness of the metal knobs give a very high-end, pro feel about this device.

Minutes after the unboxing, I was already recording my first video. I was blown away by the sound quality (in my monitoring headphones, that is) and record the first video clip in a couple of takes.

What I somewhat expected, but thought would be a non-factor because of the crisp monitoring sound, was the following: recording audio in a large, square room without carpet or curtains is **not a good idea**. The echo is nasty.

Here is the intro video in question. Iâ€™ll let you be the judge on the amount of echo in my voice. You can also tell itâ€™s my first screencast ever. I have stage fright, even if Iâ€™m alone in my home office.

Despite the average audio quality â€” I am happy with this first video.

**I have done it**.

My first bit of screencast material is out there on youtube. It announces a full series coming up â€” which again pro-actively makes me commit to deliver.

I am currently committing to deliver to a whopping YouTube follower base ofâ€¦ **two users**. But still! ðŸ˜‚

## A questionable DYI Recording Booth

Following the poor audio quality on the first video, I went ahead and googled some DYI soundproofing / echo killing tips, and spoke to some great people in a few Slack channels.

I also remember from my audio engineering 6-month certificate at SAE, 15 years ago, that fabric sucks up a lot of echo and a wardrobe is therefore a cool place to hide and record some sneaky audio clips.

I donâ€™t have a proper wardrobe anymore, but I got a mean towel rack that, enhanced with my two winter hoodies, made for a pretty good, slightly random recording studio.

Hereâ€™s what it looked like. Yes, I zipped the two hoodies together to the top and ducked my head under there.

I received some good feedback on this setup, and some people shared similar stories of coming up with random pillows / curtains / clothes to scare the echo away.

## It most definitely worked

All I can say is the effort was well worth it. In about 5 minutes of intense engineering and with a budget of zero dollars, I brought a significant improvement to the audio quality of my recordings.

If you watched the first video, you should hear a clear difference in this one. I also noticed **my stage fright voice going away** within the first 5 seconds of talking, and I was then much more comfortable. Must be getting some experience!

Thatâ€™s much better, _right_?

A few minutes later, I had video #3 uploaded.

Thatâ€™s it for now. I will wait for my pop filter to arrive early next week before continuing with the series.

## The bottom line

So, why am I telling you all this? To be honest, I am not quite sure. All I know is I am really happy to have finally started doing the series.

It's really not much. But - and this is the key here - I have put myself out there and produced something. **I have stopped talking about it and have actually started doing it**.

## Take the leap

Each one of us, in web development or any other field, have some ideas / challenges in our mind. We tend to make up excuses, consciously or not, that give good reasons not to do it right now.

I challenge you, dear reader, to do it. Whatever it is that is brewing inside you. That thing you think about sometimes, but never get to actually make it happen.

**I challenge you to take the leap**.
