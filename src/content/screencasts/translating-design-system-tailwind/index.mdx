<IntroText>

Tailwind CSS is not just a CSS framework. <strong>It's a framework to build your own custom CSS framework</strong>. Define your design tokens that translate to utility classes, and start building!

</IntroText>

In this video, we build a purposely custom design with Taiwind CSS. By customising the Tailwind config file, we get what feels like a bespoke CSS framework created just for this specific project!

And, well... that's exactly what it is! âœ¨

Enjoy the video.
