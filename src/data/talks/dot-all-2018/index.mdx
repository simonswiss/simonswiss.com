On the 28th September 2018, for the first time of my life, I stepped on stage at an [international tech conference](https://dotall.com/simon-vrachliotis).

It was scary, but I am still alive! 🤓

The conference in question is [dotAll 2018](http://dotall.com/simon-vrachliotis), the [CraftCMS](https://simonswiss.com/talks/CraftCMS) conference held in Berlin, Germany.

I was nervous out there, but based on the feedback I got after the talk, things went pretty well!

Here's the video, enjoy! 😎
