Container queries are changing the game. Browser support is getting really good, so it's time to embrace a new CSS/Tailwind skill! ðŸ’…

</IntroText>

For now, you need to install a [first-party plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-container-queries) to get container queries working in Tailwind. But soon, this will be added to Tailwind core.

Be sure to [check the browser support](https://caniuse.com/css-container-queries) before using those!
