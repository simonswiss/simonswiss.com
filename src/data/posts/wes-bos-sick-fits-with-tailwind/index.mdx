<IntroText>

This video was initially meant to be a live stream with Wes. But there was so much content to go through, and I decided to make a "semi-polished" video instead.

</IntroText>

You may have heard of Wes Bos' [Advanved Reacgt and GraphQL](https://advancedreact.com) course. If you haven't, check it out - it's great!

In this screencast, I rebuild the UI of the "Sick Fits" app used in Wes' course.

There's a bunch of customisations in the Taiwind config in this one. It's a bit long, but I'm sure you'll find plenty of value in it.

Enjoy!
